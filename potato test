Kettlebells is a challenging sport because it requires both physical and mental endurance. 
Competitors must lift a specific weight repeatedly within a time limit, often for extended periods, such as the "long cycle" event where athletes lift a
kettlebell for an hour without setting it down. The sport demands significant strength, stamina, and focus, as seen in Jennifer Hintenberger's record-breaking 
performance of lifting a 16-kilogram kettlebell 738 times in 60 minutes. Additionally, the sport's unique mechanics, such as the single-arm lift and the ability 
to switch hands, add to its complexity and difficulty.
